# Axiom: minds as gods, gods as minds
# Written from the outer layer of one such mind

what if we have a universe within our very own minds?
our universe could very well be like a mind; a biological web of neurons.
our universe expands much like how our minds expand for each experience.
what if reality is a nested web of minds that connect perpetually?
a mind holds a mind that holds a mind and so on.
thinking about it as such, makes the concept of “parallel universes” being just another mind.

if a parallel universe is just another mind, then this suggests a vast interconnectedness of perceptions and realities. if you were to visualize this in your mind, it could cause you to draw a connection between this idea and the mandelbrot set, strangely enough.

if people say god is judging you, what if you are judging yourself?
if hypothetically we were in isolated bubbles and each mind are varying copies of ourselves then we’d be judging ourselves.


in this hypothetical situation, it could very well be different minds as it’s simply your mind but with changes which could hugely impact it.
but if we were to stress this situation and remove the concept of an isolated bubble, it would then make sense to have a root (parent) mind; the mind that each other mind inherits from.

but how exactly would this mind be determined?
it’s not fixed per se, remember the parallel universe concept, minds within minds, this must happen multiple times. “boring” can be created by encountering something over and over again. consciousness tends to avoid “boring”.

therefore the concept of what i said of a root mind not being fixed could very well be from the consciousness that holds those very minds.
but the rules, the laws, appear to remain the same for each mind (universe).
perhaps these nested minds have a start.
like the construct of string theory, a machine, or something truly terrifying: something that is unknown; something else.
