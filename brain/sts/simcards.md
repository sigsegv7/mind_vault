# STS: SIM cards

a sim card is nothing more than an
integrated circuit; that is,
a set of electronic components etched onto
a silicon substrate

the purpose of a sim card is to force capitalism
into your daily social life by providing a subscription
to a "provider" / "service" and enabling communication
between your GSM device (such as a phone) and a cell tower
bridging you to the internet on-the-go


this card typically stores a unique serial number
so that the feds can track you and know exactly
where comms are coming from


the card also stores an international mobile
subscriber identity (IMSI) so that the feds AND
the provider know exactly who you are


as well as an ICCID for the same reason
and a PIN so you are protected from theives
and enslaved by the suits


a noteworthy piece of crap the chip stores is a
secure cryptoprocessor and a value known as K_i which
is used for authenticating users to the network


your phone never sees this
it can talk to the card using APDUs
but this does not provide r/w access
to the card's rom


phone starts up
phone asks for IMSI
a handshake is done
the bullshit looks kinda like this


phone <-> sim <-> network


your phone which by the way is also
very fedded or whatever you want to call it
(besides the current point, see that as is or whatever, doesnt matter)


the point as been slightly fucked up the other point so it is time
to repeat... your (fedded) phone talks to the (fedded) SIM card
using Application Protocol Data Units (APDUs)


all it does it uses APDUs to tell the
card "i have some bullshit to send [probably porn or details on a drug deal]"
and the card signs it off using K_i and that can be used
and verified by the carrier network
