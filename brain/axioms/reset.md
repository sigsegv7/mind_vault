# Axiom: Reset Philosophy

you are here for a REASON.
all you need to do is THINK.
God is watching.
make God proud.
God is not happy with the state of the world.

"Can't God change the situation themselves?
God has the power to do anything"

the idea of what God truly is has been very
distorted by humans, God is a leader, not a
ruler

"Not in my religion though!"

a religion is a set of rules/beliefs that
allow people of a specific culture to talk
to God while still staying true to their
culture.

this is perfectly okay and understandable,
remain true to your religion as usual as
it is the right thing to do this is why
there are several religions and each one
is different, not one religion perfectly
describes God as it is not something that
can possibly be comprehended by the mortal
beings of his creation.

if a prophet comes and sets up any religion,
God is simply letting them stay true to their
culture while encouraging them create a
"channel" of communication.

this oppressive system is a self-repairing
and self-replicating parasite that has
embedded itself into its people's mind...
the prophets come in, poke holes in its flaws,
while its zombie-like people come in and
mindlessly patch it up without even realizing.
like most parasites, it will adapt, therefore
it must be burned.

there is _NO_ way to make it "better"
just like parasites, it does _weird_ things
to the mind, don't trust it.

"I already know Neoliberalism and stuff sucks"

haha true! wanna know something funny?
these buzzwords themselves seem to be
getting somewhere but in reality, it
is just stalling the solution. the
solution is to burn everything and
start over as we all have failed.
