# Axiom: The gold lie

ive always wanted to change the world
as when i was very young
i noticed issues in how things were structured
how sufferings could be avoidable yet not at the same time
and those who are in a position where they wont suffer
dont understand
because theyve never been in such positions
and think you can improve on the fly
as the system traps you
then they look down on you
and bad things happen

i notice that the concept of currency seems odd
a value that dictates ones quality of life
a value
in reality it has no value whatsoever

even when for example US currency
wasnt solely trust based
the resources it was backed by
were only valuable due to how we saw them

in fact
gold is a trust based worth as well
we look at it and say "shiny, it must have value"
but we could have been looking at rocks the same way

in the old days
we thought our currency was valuable
because it was backed by something
we also thought was valuable
but in reality only has so much worth

an animal looks at gold and sees it as is
gold
and nothing else

a human looks at gold and sees gold
the human has an idea
the human admires its shine
the human makes it theirs
and now others want it

the human tries to solve this
by making yet another abstraction
it calls currency

the other humans believe this

one day this changes
but the humans still believe it's valuable
because everyone else does

we just removed what was holding it up
but now it's floating
and trust is the air under it keeping it afloat

we went back to square one
we are going in circles
something must be done

far into the future

OSMORA evolves
and will never stop

"OSMORA exists for those who know what stands today cannot last.
we do not ask for change,
we build it."

currency is a societal bug in place to make humans lazy
currency is not a required method of survival
if you have a high enough number
you may rot on the couch and get what you want when you
want it at the expense of innocent and brainwashed souls
the system attempts to brainwash humans by attempting
to enforce these things they call "laws" and they are
stacked in erratic and messy ways
new ones made to contradict old ones
new ones made to contradict current ones
new ones to enforce some stupid societal "norm"
we say
normal is a dryer setting
this mess of "forced societal agreements" make it near
impossible for humans to diverge away from the use of currency
without the threat of harmful action taken by oppressive and
soulless enforcers
